# Rules

## Campaign Holders:

1.Nudity is not allowed

>Banned content includes photos, videos, and GIFs of human genitalia, female-presenting nipples, and any media involving sex acts, including illustrations. The exceptions include nude classical statues and political protests that feature nudity. The new guidelines exclude text, so erotica remains permitted. Illustrations and art that feature breastfeeding and after-birth photos are still okay.

2.Self-harm is not allowed

>Aiding and abetting and encouraging somebody to end their life by suicide is illegal, anybody who, on or offline, through imagery or words, verbal or written, says you should do it like this, is banned.

3.Refuse to Call People ‘Users’

>Labeling people as users strips them of complexity. It reduces humans to a single behavior, effectively supporting a view of people as more like robots whose sole function is to use a product or feature. This is a poor ethos for building ethical technology.

## End users

1.People must report contents or content providers which are breaking the rules and keep themselves and other users away from the content.
