# Rules

## Campaign Holders:

1. Nudity is not allowed

>Banned content includes photos, videos, and GIFs of human genitalia, female-presenting nipples, and any media involving sex acts, including illustrations. The exceptions include nude classical statues and political protests that feature nudity. The new guidelines exclude text, so erotica remains permitted. Illustrations and art that feature breastfeeding and after-birth photos are still okay.

2. Self-harm is not allowed

>Aiding and abetting and encouraging somebody to end their life by suicide is illegal, anybody who, on or offline, through imagery or words, verbal or written, says you should do it like this, is banned.

## End users

1. Users must report contents or content providers which are breaking the rules and keep themselves and other users away from the content.
